          <div class="body-text">For as long as I can remember, I have always been interested in taking apart and figuring out how the things around me work. My passion for all things technology was clear to everyone around me. From spending all day attempting to fix old broken desktops, to just messing around with random parts and pieces I had, my thirst for knowledge could not be quenched. I would spend hours in my parents garage taking apart anything and everything that I could get my young hands on. This love for learning how things work has over the years driven me to explore and vastly expand my knowledge of electronics. This growing understanding has allowed me to channel this passion into multiple meaningful ventures.

          <div class="body-text">My motivation for all things electronic has led me to pursue my degree, Computer Engineering at Miami Oxford of Ohio.
